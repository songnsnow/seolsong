# Read files and save R objects using file names from tibble: https://community.rstudio.com/t/read-files-and-save-r-objects-using-file-names-from-tibble/91588

# note: `list.files` can create a list of all files in a folder for you

names <- list("iris.csv", "cars.csv", "faithful.csv")

# write the files, so we can show how to read them in
mapply(write.csv, data, names) # save the files as csvs

# read the files into R and create a single list of data sets

# save as rds - one list object with all three datasets

# save as three separate rds files
# change the file extension
